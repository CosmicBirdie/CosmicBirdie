• my name is stanley, but i'd rather you call me birdie :) !! 

• i'm an adult, btw. I dont mind minors interacting with me or sitting with me, but I am not interested in getting close.

• i am ok with C+H, kissing, booping, etc... as long as it's kept platonic. (do NOT flirt with me... even if you only intend it to be friendly)

• unless my name says otherwise, i don't mind if you just come up to interact with me, especially other south park ponies!! 

• usually i am off-tab/away, so if i don't respond then send me a whisper !! 

• please stop asking me about supporter benefits ;-; if you really need it why not support the game yourself?
